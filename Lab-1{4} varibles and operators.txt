4.python program to find the area of a triangle whose sides are given

a = float(input('Enter the length of the first side: '))
b = float(input('Enter the length of the second side: '))
c = float(input('Enter the length of the third side: '))

s = (a + b + c) / 2
import math
area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

print(f'The area of the triangle with sides {a}, {b}, and {c} is: {area:.2f}')
